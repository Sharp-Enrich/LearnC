!!! note "总结"
    + Storage for a large number of objects or for objects that are large in size can be allocated and freed dynamically. We have to keep track of this storage carefully
    + Identifier visibility and storage duration are different things.
    + Initialization must be done systematically with a coherent strategy for each type.
    + C’s allocation strategy for local variables maps well to low-level handling of function stacks.
