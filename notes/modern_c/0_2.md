!!! note "总结"
    + C distinguishes the lexical structure (the punctuators, identifiers, and numbers), the grammatical structure (syntax), and the semantics (meaning) of programs.
    + All identifiers (names) must be declared such that we know the properties of the concept they represent.
    + All objects (things that we deal with) and functions (methods that we use to deal with things) must be defined; that is, we must specify how and where they come to be.
    + Statements indicate how things are going to be done: iterations (for) repeat variations of a certain tasks, functions calls (printf(...)) delegate a task to a function, and function returns (return something;) go back where we came from.
