!!! abstract "本章内容提要"
    + Grouping objects into arrays
    + Using pointers as opaque types
    + Combining objects into structures
    + Giving types new names with `typedef`

!!! note "总结"
    + Arrays combine several values of the same base type into one object.
    + Pointers refer to other objects, are null, or are indeterminate.
    + Structures combine values of different base types into one object.
    + typedefs provide new names for existing types.
