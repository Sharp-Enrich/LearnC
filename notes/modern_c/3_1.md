    + 编写行内函数 ｜ Writing inline functions
    + 限制/约束指针 ｜ Restricting pointers
    + 测量检视性能 ｜ Measuring and inspecting performance

!!! note "总结"
    + Performance should not be traded for correctness.
    + inline is an adequate tool to optimize small, pure, functions in place.
    + restrict helps to deal with aliasing properties of function parameters. It has to be used with care, because it imposes restrictions on the calling side of the function that may not be enforceable at compile time.
    + Claims of performance improvements must be accompanied by thorough measurements and statistics.
