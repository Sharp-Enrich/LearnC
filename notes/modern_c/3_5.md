!!! note "总结"
    + The "happens before" relation is the only possible way to reason about timing between different threads. It is only established through synchronization that uses either atomic objects or very specific C library functions.
    + Sequential consistency is the default consistency model for atomics, but not for other C library functions. It additionally assumes that all corresponding synchronization events are totally ordered. This is an assumption that can be expensive.
    + Explicitly using acquire-release consistency can lead to more efficient code, but it needs a careful design to supply the correct arguments to the atomic functions with a _explicit suffix.
