!!! note "总结"
    + It is important to ensure that shared data is properly initialized before it is accessed concurrently. This is best done at compile time or from main. As a last resort, call_once can be used to trigger the execution of an initializing function exactly once.
    + Threads should preferably only operate on data that is local, through function arguments and automatic variables. If unavoidable, thread-specific data can also 
    be created as thread_local objects or via tss_create. Use the latter only when you need dynamic construction and destruction of the variable.
    + Small critical data that is shared between threads should be specified as _Atomic.
    + Critical sections (code paths that operate on unprotected shared data) must be protected, usually by using a mtx_t mutex.
    + Conditional processing dependencies between threads are modeled with cnd_t condition variables.
    + Thread code that does not have the ability to rely on a post mortem cleanup by main should use thrd_detach and place all its cleanup code in atexit and/or at_quick_exit handlers.
