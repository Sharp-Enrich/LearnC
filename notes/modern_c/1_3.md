!!! note "总结"
    + C programs run in an abstract state machine that is mostly independent of the
    + All basic C types are kinds of numbers, but not all of them can be used directly for arithmetic.
    + Values have a type and a binary representation.
    + When necessary, types of values are implicitly converted to fit the needs of particular places where they are used.
    + Variables must be explicitly initialized before their first use.
    + Integer computations give exact values as long as there is no overflow.
    + Floating-point computations only give approximated results that are cut off after a certain number of binary digits.
