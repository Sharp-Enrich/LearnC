!!! abstract "本章内容提要"
    + Introduction to simple functions
    + Working with main
    + Understanding recursion

!!! note "总结"
    + Functions have a prototype that determines how they can be called.
    + Terminating main and calling exit are the same.
    + Each function call has its own copy of local variables and can be called recursively
