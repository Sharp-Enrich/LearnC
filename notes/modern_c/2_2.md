!!! note "总结"
    + For each part of a program, we have to distinguish the object (what are we doing?), the purpose (what are we doing it for?), the method (how are we doing it?) and the implementation (in which manner are we doing it?).
    + The function and type interfaces are the essence of software design. Changing them later is expensive.
    + An implementation should be as literal as possible and obvious in its control flow. Complicated reasoning should be avoided and made explicit where necessary.
