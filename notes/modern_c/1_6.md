!!! note "总结"
    + The C library is interfaced via a bunch of header files.
    + Mathematical functions are best used via the type-generic macros from tgmath.h.
    + Input and output (IO) are interfaced via stdio.h. There are functions that do IO as text or as raw bytes. Text IO can be direct or structured by formats.
    + String processing uses functions from ctype.h for character classification, from stdlib for numerical conversion, and from string.h for string manipulation.
    + Time handling in time.h has calendar time that is structured for human interpretation, and physical time that is structured in seconds and nanoseconds.
    + Standard C only has rudimentary interfaces to describe the execution environment of a running program; getenv provides access to environment variables, and locale.h regulates the interface for human languages.
