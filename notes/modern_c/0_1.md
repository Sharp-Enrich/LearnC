!!! note "总结"
    + C is designed to give computers orders. Thereby it mediates between us (the programmers) and computers.
    + C must be compiled to be executed. The compiler provides the translation between the language that we understand (C) and the specific needs of the particular platform.
    + C gives a level of abstraction that provides portability. One C program can be used on many different computer architectures.
    + The C compiler is there to help you. If it warns you about something in your program, listen to it.
