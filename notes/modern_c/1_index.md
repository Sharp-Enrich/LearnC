这个级别将使你熟悉C编程语言:也就是说，它将为你提供足够的知识来编写和使用好的C程序。这里的“好”指的是对语言的现代理解，避免了早期C语言方言的大多数缺陷，并为您提供了一些以前不存在的结构，这些结构可以移植到从手机到大型计算机的绝大多数现代计算机体系结构中。完成这些部分后，您应该能够编写满足日常需求的简短代码:不是非常复杂，但有用且可移植This level will acquaint you with the C programming language: that is, it will provide you with enough knowledge to write and use good C programs. “Good” here refers to a modern understanding of the language, avoiding most of the pitfalls of early dialects of C, and offering you some constructs that were not present before and that are portable across the vast majority of modern computer architectures, from your cell phone to a mainframe computer. Having worked through these sections, you should be able to write short code for everyday needs: not extremely sophisticated, but useful and portable.
