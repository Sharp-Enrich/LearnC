!!! note "总结"
    + The memory and object model have several layers of abstraction: physical memory, virtual memory, storage instances, object representation, and binary representation.
    + Each object can be seen as an array of unsigned char.
    + unions serve to overlay different object types over the same object representation.
    + Memory can be aligned differently according to the need for a specific data type. In particular, not all arrays of unsigned char can be used to represent any object type.
