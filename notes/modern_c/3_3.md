!!! note "总结"
    + The execution of C code is not always linearly sequenced, even if there are no parallel threads or asynchronous signals. As a consequence, some evaluations may have results that depend on ordering choices by the compiler.
    + setjmp/longjmp are powerful tools to handle exceptional conditions across a whole series of nested function calls. They may interact with optimization and require that some variables be protected with a volatile qualification.
    + C’s interface of handling synchronous and asynchronous signals is rudimentary. Therefore, signal handlers should do as little work as possible and just mark the type of the interrupt condition in a global flag. They should then switch back to the interrupted context and handle the interrupt condition there.
    + Information can only be passed to and from signal handlers by using volatile sig_atomic_t, atomic_flag, or other lock-free atomic data types.
