!!! note "总结"
    + Arithmetic operators do math. They operate on values.
    + Assignment operators modify objects.
    + Comparison operators compare values and return 0 or 1.
    + Function calls and most operators evaluate their operands in a nonspecific order. Only &&, ||, and ?: impose an ordering on the evaluation of their operands.
