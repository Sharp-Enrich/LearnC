    + 泛型编程 ｜ Type-generic programming

!!! note "总结"
    + Function-like macros are more flexible than inline functions.
    + They can be used to complement function interfaces with compile-time argument checks and to provide information from the calling environment or default arguments.
    + They allow us to implement type-safe features with variable argument lists.
    + In combination with _Generic, they can be used to implement type-generic interfaces.
