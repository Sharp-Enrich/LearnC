!!! note "总结"
    + The C library has several interfaces for text processing, but we must be careful about const-qualification and buffer overflow.
    + Formatted input with scanf (and similar) has subtle issues with pointer types, null termination of strings, white space, and new-line separation. If possible, you
should use the combination of fgets with strtod or similar, more specialized, functions.
    + Extended character sets are best handled by using multibyte strings. With some caution, these can be used much like ordinary strings for input and output.
    + Binary data should be written to binary files by using fwrite and fread. Such files are platform dependent.
    + Calls to C library functions should be checked for error returns.
    + Handling error conditions can lead to complicated case analysis. It can be organized by a function-specific code block to which we jump with goto statements.
